# **Blink Library Feature**
---

## üìã Overview

The Blink feature abstracts low-level pin operations for LED control functionality within the Atinverter library. It includes methods for setting up GPIO pins as outputs, controlling individual LEDs, and cycling through multiple LEDs in a predefined sequence.

## üìù Method Descriptions

## `void setUpLEDs()`

**Purpose:** Configures all LED pins as outputs.

**Pseudocode:**
1. Configure the state of all 4 LED pins as outputs for driving.

**Implementation in `Atinverter.cpp`:**
```cpp
void Atinverter::setUpLEDs() {
  pinMode(LED1R_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED1G_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED2R_PIN, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(LED2G_PIN, OUTPUT);
}
```
<br>

## `void set1LED(int LED, int state)`

**Purpose:** Sets a user-selected LED pin as on or off.

**Pseudocode:**
1. Sets a user-selected LED pin as on (HIGH) or off (LOW).

**Implementation in `Atinverter.cpp`:**
```cpp
void Atinverter::set1LED(int LED, int state) {
  digitalWrite(LED, state);
}
```
<br>

## `void cycleLEDs(int t_delay)`

**Purpose:** Sequentially cycles through four LEDs, turning each on and off with a delay.

**Pseudocode:**
1. Turns on each LED in order with a delay in between in milliseconds
2. Turns off each LED in reverse order with a delay in between in milliseconds

**Implementation in `Atinverter.cpp`:**
```cpp
void Atinverter::cycleLEDs(int t_delay) {
  digitalWrite(LED1G_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(t_delay);
  digitalWrite(LED1R_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(t_delay);
  digitalWrite(LED2G_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(t_delay);
  digitalWrite(LED2R_PIN, HIGH);
  delay(t_delay);

  digitalWrite(LED2R_PIN, LOW);
  delay(t_delay);
  digitalWrite(LED2G_PIN, LOW);
  delay(t_delay);
  digitalWrite(LED1R_PIN, LOW);
  delay(t_delay);
  digitalWrite(LED1G_PIN, LOW);
  delay(t_delay);
}
```
