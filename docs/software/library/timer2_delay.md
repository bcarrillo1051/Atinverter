# **‚è±Ô∏è Timer 2 Delay**
***

An interface is required to handle **program delays** for time-sensitive operations such as **AC voltage sensing** and **serial communication**, among other tasks.

{: .highlight-yellow }
> üí≠ "Why not use the Arduino core functions `delay()`, `millis()`, or `micros()` to accomplish this?"

Although that might seem like the most straightforward approach, the **ATMEGA328P Timer0** ‚Äî used by these core functions ‚Äî is also responsible for **PWM generation** in our hardware. This is described in detail in the [PWM Control](PWM_control) section.

If we attempt to use the core delay functions (which reconfigure Timer0 registers), while simultaneously using Timer0 to handle PWM interrupts, we risk introducing **conflicting register states**. This also translates to erratic behavior in our PWM output which although may not be catastrophic, it is certainly not desired üòÖ.

{: .highlight-yellow }
> üí≠ "Why not create a software-based delay program with an incrementer?"

```cpp
unsigned long counter = 0;
while (counter < SOME_VALUE) {
  counter++;
}
```

To implement `delay2()` and `millis2()`, it‚Äôs not practical to only rely on a simple software incrementer (e.g., `counter++`) inside a loop to create timing. This would be an approach that requires trial-and-error tuning of a maximum value to achieve a desired delay. In addition, this is inefficient, non-deterministic, and highly sensitive to compiler optimizations or clock speed changes.

---

## üí° The Workaround

To resolve this, we developed custom timing functions ‚Äî `delay2()` and `millis2()` ‚Äî based on **Timer2** from the ATMEGA328P. These serve as effective substitutes for the Arduino core library timing functions, providing a **millisecond-based timing mechanism** that operates **independently of Timer0**.

---

## üß† Understanding the Timers on the ATMEGA328P

The ATMEGA328P includes **three timers**, each with different bit widths:

1. **Timer0**: 8-bit  
2. **Timer1**: 16-bit  
3. **Timer2**: 8-bit

{: .highlight-yellow }
> üí≠ "What do the 'bits' actually mean?"

The number of **bits** determines how high a timer can count before it overflows and restarts.

Think of it like a clock ‚è±Ô∏è
- An **8-bit timer** can count from `0` to `255` ($2^8 - 1$)
- A **16-bit timer** can count from `0` to `65,535` ($2^{16} - 1$)

A higher bit-width means higher resolution is possible ‚Äî but for a simple 1ms tick, an 8-bit timer like Timer2 is more than sufficient.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Timer2 Delay Initialization

We need to configure the handy Timer 2 such that its interrupts will fire every 1ms. 

{: .highlight-yellow }
> üí≠ "Why trigger the interrupts every 1ms? Can't you use another time frame?"

Yes, you can definitely use another timer frame, but why would you reasonably do that? Consider these reasons why 1ms interrupts are most appropriate:
1. ‚òëÔ∏è Arduino's built-in `millis()` and `delay()` functions are based on 1ms resolution.
2. üîÑ Simpler math and high enough resolution (1:1 mapping)
    - 500 ticks $\rightarrow$ count to 500 ticks where each counter tick is 1ms instead of 2000 ticks $\rightarrow$ count to 2000 ticks where each tick is 0.25ms
3. ‚öôÔ∏è Low CPU Overhead
    - Operating the CPU at higher frequency can overwhelm the CPU and be more power intensive

Okay now that I hopefully convinced you of why we need 1ms interrupts, here is how we do it:
As per the registers described in pages 127-134 of the [ATMEGA328P datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf), these are what we will need to configure. There are 9 registers in total, but we do not need to configure all of them. 

<br>
The registers of interest and what is needed to do is as follows:

{: .highlight-green }
üîß TCCR2A ‚Äì Timer/Counter Control Register A

**Reset TCCR2A**: 

Avoids unexpected behavior from previously set states and allows for a known clean slate.
```cpp
TCCR2A = 0; // Reset Timer2 TCCR2A control register
```

**What It Controls**:
- **Compare Output Modes `COM2A[1:0], COM2B[1:0]`** ‚Äî what happens to OC2A/OC2B (digital 11/3) pins on compare match with TCNT2
- **Waveform Generation Mode `WGM2[1:0]`** ‚Äî selects the timer's counting behavior (Normal, PWM/Phase Correct, CTC, or Fast PWM)


**What To Set**:
- Clear Timer on Compare Match (CTC) mode using WGM21 bit

```cpp
TCCR2A |= (1 << WGM21); // Set CTC mode
```
<br>

{: .highlight-green }
üîß TCCR2B ‚Äì Timer/Counter Control Register B

**Reset TCCR2B**: 

Avoids unexpected behavior from previously set states and allows for a known clean slate.
```cpp
TCCR2B = 0; // Reset Timer2 TCCR2B control register
```

**What It Controls**:
- **Force Output Compare `FOC2B, FOC2A`** ‚Äî forcing a compare match on OC2B/OC2A (digital 3/11) pins
- **Waveform Generation Mode `WGM22`** ‚Äî Used with TCCR2A for CTC or fast PWM
- **Clock Select `CS2[2:0]`** ‚Äî Sets the pre-scaler for the timer clock source 

**What To Set**:
- Prescaler of 64 using CS22 bit

```cpp
TCCR2B |= (1 << CS22); // Set prescaler = 64
```
<br>

{: .highlight-green }
üîß TCNT2 ‚Äì Timer/Counter Register

**Reset TCNT2**: 

Starts counter at 0, why would you start anywhere else? üòÖ
```cpp
TCNT2 = 0; // Reset Timer2 TCNT2 control register
```

**What It Controls**:
- **Timer Counter 2 `TCNT2[7:0]`** ‚Äî The current value of Timer2‚Äôs counter (0-255)

**What To Set**:
- Nothing, the timer runs autonomously

<br>

{: .highlight-green }
üîß TIMSK2 ‚Äì Timer/Counter2 Interrupt Mask Register

**Reset TIMSK2**: 

Avoids unexpected behavior from previously set states and allows for a known clean slate.
```cpp
TIMSK2 = 0; // Reset Timer2 TIMSK2 control register
```

**What It Controls**:
- **Output Compare Match Interrupt Enables `OCIE2B, OCIE2A`** ‚Äî Enables an interrupt when the timer value `TCNT2` matches the value in `OCR2B` or `OCR2A`.
- **Waveform Generation Mode `TOIE2`** ‚Äî Enables an interrupt when timer overflows

**What To Set**:
- Enable interrupt on Compare Match A using the OCIE2A bit.

```cpp
TIMSK2 = (1 << OCIE2A); // enable compare interrupt
```
<br>

{: .highlight-green }
üîß OCR2A ‚Äì Output Compare Register A

**What It Controls:**
- Holds the top value the TCNT2 counts up to in **CTC mode**.
- When `TCNT2 == OCR2A`, an interrupt is fired (if enabled), and the counter resets to 0 on the next tick.

**What To Set:**
- OCR2A register to 249

```cpp
OCR2A = 249;
```

**Why Set it To 249:**
- This value can be computed based on the equation provided in page 121 of the \
[ATMEGA328P datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/Atmel-7810-Automotive-Microcontrollers-ATmega328P_Datasheet.pdf?).

**(1) General CTC equation (when toggling pin):**

$$f_{OCnx} = \frac{f_{clk_{I/O}}}{2 \times N \times (1 + OCRnx)}$$

where:
- $OCRnx$ is the output compare register value 
- $f_{OCnx}$ is the output frequency of the timer/counter
- $f_{clk_{I/O}}$ Clock input frequency (16 MHz for ATmega328P)
- N is the timer prescale factor (1, 8, 32, 64, 128, 256, or 1024) 
- "2" in denominator only needed when toggling a pin to generate a waveform 

üîç**Important Note:** In interrupt-only CTC mode (no pin toggling), the "2" in the denominator is not included because the interrupt occurs once per timer cycle. Hence, this constant can be ignored.

**(2) CTC Interrupt-Only Frequency Equation:**

$$f_{OCnx} = \frac{f_{clk_{I/O}}}{ N \times (1 + OCRnx)}$$

Now, we can solve for the OCR2A value that produces an interrupt at a frequency of 1kHz (1ms period) by restructuring this equation.

**(3) CTC Interrupt-Only OCR2A Equation:**

$$OCRnx = \frac{f_{clk_{I/O}}}{N \times f_{OCnx}} - 1$$

üî¢ **Solving for OCR2A:**

$$OCRnx = \frac{16*10^6}{64 \times 1000} - 1 = 249$$

‚úÖ **Result:**

Setting OCR2A = 249 results in 1ms timer interrupts using a 16 MHz clock and a prescaler of 64. 

And we are done! Those are all the registers you need to set. Now when you look at the Timer 2 register initialization, it should now make more sense üòä
