# **Atinverter V2 Library Reference**
***

The Atinverter library is comprised of two files: `Atinverter.h` and `Atinverter.cpp`. The header file serves as the blueprint containing the Atinverter class definition, along with its method declarations and member variables. The implementation for the Atinverter class and initilization of member variables are defined in `Atinverter.cpp`. At a high level, the Atinverter is essentially just two files as illustrated below:

Upon further inspection of the Atinverter Library, we can observe that it is organized into five main sections based on functionality. To learn more about each section and their respective methods, refer to [Software Modules](../modules/modules).
