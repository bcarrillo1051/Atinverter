# **Atinverter V2 Library Reference**
***

The Atinverter V2 library is comprised of two files: `Atinverter.h` and `Atinverter.cpp`. The header file serves as the blueprint containing the Atinverter class definition, along with its method declarations and member variables. The implementation for the Atinverter class and initilization of member variables are defined in `Atinverter.cpp`. At a high level, the Atinverter is essentially just two files as illustrated below:

Upon further inspection of the Atinverter Library, we can observe that it is organized into five main sections based on functionality. The nodes for the five features of the library are interactiveâ€”click to explore specific software functionality and learn more about its design. Additionally, the code is thoroughly documented within the program files, so these sections will focus primarily on providing an overview of the design and any algorithms that were implemented.
