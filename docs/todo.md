# **TO-DO**


- [X] Order NOR gate and verify that logic protection circuitry is operational
- [ ] Verify that schematic, PCB, and 3D model is not missing anything (run DRC again just in case)
- [ ] Load testing captures
- [ ] Update UML diagram
- [ ] Update the Vision section, too sparse right now
