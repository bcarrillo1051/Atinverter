## Microgrid Significance
Electricity traverses through a large network of interconnected transmission or distribution systems known as the power grid.
With the ever-growing demand for electricity and reliable power grid consumption, grid congestion has been a more prominent phenomenon. This occurs when the power grid is unable to deliver the required power to meet demand, particularly from urban area or high demand loads.

To alleviate stress on the power grid, microgrids-smaller localized electrical systems-can be employed. A microgrid typically consists of distributed generators and loads as well as energy storage systems, and can operate either in grid-connected or islanded mode.

## EV Inspired PDA Microgrid and Open Source Platforms
As Electric Vehicle (EV) infrastructure continues to develop and gain wider global acceptance, there is growing motivation not only to utilize these systems for transportation but, more importantly, to harness their microgrid capabilities. To more clearly understand this concept, we can consider a power distribution architecture (PDA) for EVs that can:
1. intelligently transact power with the grid, 
2. provide important grid-forming and grid-supporting services
3. share power in a peer-to-peer fashion with other EVs
4. act as a standalone microgrid that can interface with external AC and DC sources and loads.
5. operate and communicate between various open source power converters
